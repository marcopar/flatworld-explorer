This software has been discontinued.
Source code relicensed under the Apache License 2.0

While the source code may still be of some use to someone, the application does not work since map servers used to get the satellite imagery do not work anymore.
Also, in the meanwhile, NASA Worldwind has been ported to Java and they now offer a great open source SDK.


_This software can be used to view earth imagery coming from satellites and available freely on the web. Images are visualized on a flat surface (like in WW2D) so you will not find mountains and 3D fancy globes rotating here, for that look at NASA Worldwind, Google Earth among the others. The good new here is that probably this software will work also on less powerful machines. Software is written in Java and that's all you need to run it. Software has been tested on Windows and Linux but it should run also on Mac._
